## Overview
In this project, we utilize TensorFlow and Keras, popular deep learning libraries, to design, train, and evaluate a CNN model for image classification. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. We preprocess the data, design the model architecture, and train it on the training set. Finally, we evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following dependencies:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```pip install tensorflow keras numpy```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification.git```
 
2. Download the CIFAR-10 dataset by visiting [this link](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz) and place it in the project directory.

3. Extract the dataset using the following command:
```tar -xf cifar-10-python.tar.gz```
 
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

5. Run the following command to execute the code:
```python image_classification.py```
 
6. The program will train the CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and display the training progress. After training, it will evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set and print the test accuracy.

## Results
The image classification system achieved an impressive accuracy of % on the CIFAR-10 dataset, accurately classifying a diverse range of 10 different classes. The model was trained using TensorFlow and Keras, utilizing functions such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers. Data preprocessing techniques were applied, resulting in a significant improvement of  compared to the baseline performance. Advanced techniques like data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning were employed to reduce overfitting by .
